# Netflix Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Netflix titles dataset for analysis. I transformed raw, inconsistent data into a structured format suitable for Machine Learning and statistical insights.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `data/netflix_titles_raw.csv`: The original dataset.
* `data/netflix_titles_cleaned.csv`: The final output after cleaning.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Highlights
Based on the analysis of the raw data, I performed the following:
* **Missing Value Imputation:** Filled nulls in `director`, `cast`, and `country` with "Unknown" or "Not Specified" to maintain dataset integrity.
* **Feature Engineering:** * Calculated `content_age` (Year Added - Release Year).
    * Extracted `month_added` and `month_name` for seasonal trend analysis.
* **Format Standardization:** Converted `date_added` to a clean `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

## 🛠️ Skills Used
* **Python / Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
* **Feature Engineering**
* **Data Standardization**
